# q1's simple point n clicker

this is a tool for making mechanically simple point n click games. my intention is that you'd collect a bunch of assets (sounds, images), dump them into a folder, and load that folder in to collage together a little game.

a basic scripting system allows for playing sounds, moving between scenes, and playing text:

- PLAY: to play a sound
- STOP: to stop a sound
- GOTO: to go to a different scene
- [TYPE]: to display text using a specific dialogue type

misc shortcuts:
- // to comment in scripts
- TAB to switch between Editor Mode and Game Mode
- RIGHT CLICK to send an object to the back
- MIDDLE CLICK or SHIFT CLICK to duplicate an object
- SCROLL to scale objects
